# JavaChain: A Distributed Blockchain Illustration

This project was the third among the 5 amazing projects of the '95-702 - Distributed Systems for Information Systems Management' course at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/). The course was taught by 3 eminent Professors of CMU - Prof. Mike McCarthy, Prof. Joe Mertz and Prof. Marty Barrett.

- Constructed a stand-alone blockchain in Java to illustrate the tamper-evident design of blockchain technology

- Created a distributed system where clients communicate with a blockchain server via encapsulated JSON messages over TCP sockets

- Utilized data validation and separated concerns in the code to ensure its robustness and maintainability

- Added functionality for creating, corrupting, repairing, viewing, and verifying the blockchain.
